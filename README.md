# hello-world
#I'm learning how to code, and this is where I try out new things. 
#I'm starting with Python, and then I'll hopefully go to SQL. 
#I'd like to eventually do some cool things around the house, or just some at home projects such as websites. 
#Eventually I would like to use my programming skills to conduct my own research.
